Ask\n\n#### Scenario\n\nMarketing team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.\n\n#### Stakeholders:\n* Director of marketing\n* Cyclistic executive team\n\n#### Objective\nHence, the objective for this analysis is to throw some light on how the two types of customers: annual members and casual riders, use Cyclistic bikeshare differently, based on few parameters that can be calculated/ obtained from existing data.\n\n#### Deliverables:\n* Insights on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently\n* Provide effective visuals and relevant data to support insights\n* Use insights to give three recommendations to convert casual riders to member riders\n\n\n## 2. Prepare\n#### Data Sources \n\nA total of **16 datasets** have been made available for each month starting from **April 2020 to July 2021**. Each dataset captures the details of every ride logged by the customers of Cyclistic. This data that has been made publicly available has been scrubbed to omit rider's personal information.\n\n#### Documentation, Cleaning and Preparation of data for analysis\n\nThe combined size of all the 16 datasets is close to 1 GB. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will be time-consuming and slow compared to SQL or R. I am choosing R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/ visualizations in the same platform. It is also an opportunity for me to learn R better.\n\n#### Load libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(tidyr)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-25T04:52:10.926076Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-25T04:52:10.93346Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-25T04:52:11.720118Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Load datasets ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tripdata_202004 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202004-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202005 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202005-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202006 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202006-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202107 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202008 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202008-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202009 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202009-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202010 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202010-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202011 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202011-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202012 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202012-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202101 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202101-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202102 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202102-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202103 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202103-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202104 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202104-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202105 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202105-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202106 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202106-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ntripdata_202107 <- read.csv(\"../input/bikeshare-data/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-25T04:52:11.723001Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-25T04:52:11.749457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.806839Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check column names of each dataset for consistency","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colnames(tripdata_202004)\ncolnames(tripdata_202005)\ncolnames(tripdata_202006)\ncolnames(tripdata_202107)\ncolnames(tripdata_202008)\ncolnames(tripdata_202009)\ncolnames(tripdata_202010)\ncolnames(tripdata_202011)\ncolnames(tripdata_202012)\ncolnames(tripdata_202101)\ncolnames(tripdata_202102)\ncolnames(tripdata_202103)\ncolnames(tripdata_202104)\ncolnames(tripdata_202105)\ncolnames(tripdata_202106)\ncolnames(tripdata_202107)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.809996Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.811354Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.899793Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check data structures and data types for all data frames","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"str(tripdata_202004)\nstr(tripdata_202005)\nstr(tripdata_202006)\nstr(tripdata_202107)\nstr(tripdata_202008)\nstr(tripdata_202009)\nstr(tripdata_202010)\nstr(tripdata_202011)\nstr(tripdata_202012)\nstr(tripdata_202101)\nstr(tripdata_202102)\nstr(tripdata_202103)\nstr(tripdata_202104)\nstr(tripdata_202105)\nstr(tripdata_202106)\nstr(tripdata_202107)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.902639Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-25T04:53:41.90391Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-25T04:53:42.204197Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data transformation and cleaning\n\nstart_station_id & end_station_id are not consistent in all datasets.
